Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states.

He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas.

      "We have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: In his farewell address, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam reflects on his five years as President of India, expressing gratitude for the experiences and interactions with diverse individuals. He highlights ten key messages gleaned from these encounters:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Accelerating development fueled by youth aspirations:** He emphasizes the importance of youth ambition, referencing a young girl named Anukriti who asked about India's development timeline. \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Empowering villages:**  Kalam underscores the need to empower India's 600,000 villages, coupled with improved connectivity, as the key to unlocking their vast potential. He cites examples like the Lead India 2020 Foundation and the Periyar PURA initiative, which demonstrate his vision for rural development.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Harnessing rural potential:**  Kalam believes that 7,000 Periyar PURA-like projects across India can bridge the rural-urban divide and propel the nation's growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Strengthening agriculture:**  A key pillar of India's economy, Kalam believes a partnership between farmers, scientists, and industries can achieve a 4% annual growth in agricultural GDP.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Overcoming challenges through collaboration and courage:** He draws inspiration from interactions with individuals like a talented musician overcoming physical challenges and the resilient spirit of the people in Urusa village after the 2005 earthquake. His visit to Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 Tsunami further solidified his belief in the power of human spirit and collaboration in overcoming adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Promoting connectivity for societal transformation:**  Kalam's Pan African e-Network proposal, aiming to connect 53 African countries through satellite, fiber optics, and wireless technology, exemplifies India's commitment to global connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Safeguarding the nation:** He celebrates the bravery and dedication of India's Defence Forces, Para-Military Forces, and Police personnel who tirelessly protect the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Fostering a youth movement for India's development:** Kalam envisions a youth movement driving India's progress towards a developed nation by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond these key messages, Kalam outlines his vision for a developed India characterized by:\n",
      "* **Accessibility to quality healthcare for all.**\n",
      "* **Responsive, transparent, and corruption-free governance.**\n",
      "* **Eradication of poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children.**\n",
      "* **A prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy nation with sustainable growth.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Through these personal anecdotes and observations, Kalam paints a picture of a hopeful future for India, driven by youth ambition, empowered villages, a robust agricultural sector, the Pan African e-Network, a strong defense force, and the indomitable human spirit. \n",
